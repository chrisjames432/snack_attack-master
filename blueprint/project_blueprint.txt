MASTER PROJECT SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Master Summary: Snack Attack (Snack_Attack-master)

1) PROJECT OVERVIEW
- What is it? A browser-based 3D arcade game prototype called Snack Attack. It started as a Three.js tech demo and has evolved into a playable game scaffold served via a Node/Express server.
- Main purpose: Demonstrate and develop a web-based 3D game where players move a character to catch healthy snacks while avoiding unhealthy ones, with real-time scoring, progression, and audio-visual feedback. It also serves as a platform to iterate gameplay systems (controls, UI, audio, visuals) in a browser environment.
- Context: The project includes a rich set of design/docs (concepts, questions, completion outlines, development summaries) and planning artifacts to guide feature expansion and polishing.

2) KEY FEATURES
- 3D game scene
  - Three.js-based rendering with a scene, camera, lights, and a render loop.
  - Loading and management of 3D assets (GLB models like candy1.glb, keyshapetest1.glb, etc.).
- Interaction and gameplay
  - Mouse/touch input with click/raycast interactions to catch items.
  - A “desire” mechanic to drive item selection and collection dynamics.
  - Scoring, level progression, and timing to drive gameplay pacing.
- Audio feedback
  - Web Audio API-based system with simple beeps and preset cues (playCorrect, playWrong, playCombo).
  - A global gameAudio instance to trigger audio events in response to gameplay events.
- UI and UX
  - Loading screen, start/menu UI, and in-game HUD.
  - Fixed side panel and responsive styling via maincss.css (with UI states for loading, gameplay, and menus).
- Development scaffolding
  - Modular JS structure (game.js core, audio.js for audio, mouse.js for pointer interactions, tween.js for animations).
  - jQuery library included (jq.js) for DOM manipulations (legacy helper).
- Architecture for growth
  - Comprehensive planning docs (ACTION_PLAN.md, DEVELOPMENT_SUMMARY.md, SUMMARY.md) outlining phases, features, and optimization targets.
  - Planned mobile optimization, UI refinements, camera tweaks, and audio enhancements in future iterations.

3) ARCHITECTURE
- Project layout
  - server.js: Express server serving static assets from public and delivering index.html at root.
  - public/: Client-side assets and UI
    - index.html: Entry point; loads styles and game modules; shows loading screen, start menu, HUD initialization.
    - public/js/: Core functionality
      - game.js: Central Three.js-based game scaffold (scene setup, asset loading, input handling, animation loop, game state: score, level, timer; desire mechanic integration).
      - audio.js: Lightweight Web Audio API system (playBeep, playCorrect, playWrong, playCombo) and a global gameAudio instance.
      - mouse.js: Utilities for mouse-driven interactions (including look-at behavior and raycasting hooks).
      - tween.module.min.js: Tween.js library for animating properties over time.
      - jq.js: Minified jQuery v1.11.0 (legacy DOM helpers).
    - public/js/*.glb, logo1.png, and other assets: 3D models and visual assets (e.g., candy1.glb, keyshapetest1.glb).
    - public/maincss.css: CSS styling for the game UI, loading screens, menus, and HUD.
  - info/: Metadata and planning hints (e.g., Capacitor note; indicates game focus).
- Data and assets
  - 3D assets and textures stored in public/js (GLB files) referenced by the game.js loader.
  - Audio cues generated on the fly via Web Audio API (no external audio assets in the provided snippet, but hooks exist).
- Documentation and planning
  - READMEs, SUMMARY.md, and design docs provide the rationale, MVP paths, and future enhancement ideas.

4) HOW IT WORKS
- Initialization
  - Page load triggers CSS/JS load; index.html bootstraps the game environment.
  - game.js initializes the Three.js scene (camera, lights, renderer), loads 3D assets, and sets up input handlers.
- Core loop and gameplay
  - The animation loop runs via requestAnimationFrame, updating scene, physics-like item movement, and game state (score, level, timer).
  - Items (snacks) fall or move into the scene; the player’s catcher/character interacts with them via raycast-based detection or direct input.
  - On catching a healthy snack, score increases; on catching an unhealthy item or missing targets, penalties may apply. A “desire” mechanic guides item selection and collection behavior.
  - Audio cues fire in response to events (correct item, wrong item, combos) through the Web Audio API.
- UI flow
  - Start menu -> game session -> HUD updates (score, level, timer) -> end-of-session UI with restart option.
- Extensibility
  - The codebase is organized for modular expansion (new items, power-ups, levels, UI panels, mobile optimizations) as documented in the action plan and development notes.

5) TECHNOLOGIES
- Frontend
  - Three.js: Core 3D rendering framework for scene, camera, lights, and 3D asset handling.
  - WebGL/HTML5: Rendering and interaction surface for the 3D game.
  - Web Audio API: Lightweight audio system for beeps and cues (playBeep, playCorrect, playWrong, playCombo).
  - Tween.js: Animation tweening library for smooth property transitions.
  - jQuery (v1.11.0): DOM manipulation and event handling (legacy helper included as jq.js).
  - GLB assets: 3D models like candy1.glb and keyshapetest1.glb for in-scene objects.
  - CSS: maincss.css for UI styling, with loading screens, menus, HUD, and responsive layout.
- Backend
  - Node.js with Express: Simple server to serve static assets and index.html; provides a minimal runtime for the game.
  - nodemon (dev dependency): Development workflow enhancement for automatic server restarts.
- Tooling and docs
  - package.json and package-lock.json: Node dependency management.
  - Documentation: Multiple planning and progress documents (ACTION_PLAN.md, DEVELOPMENT_SUMMARY.md, SUMMARY.md, etc.) guiding development, features, and roadmap.
- Extra context
  - info folder references Capacitor (mobile/web-app bridging), suggesting exploration for hybrid/mobile deployment, though the current setup is browser/web-focused.
  - The project includes an extensive set of planning and design documents indicating a staged MVP roadmap and future enhancements (UI polish, audio improvements, mobile optimization, monetization considerations, etc.).

How to run (quick start)
- Prerequisites: Node.js installed.
- Steps:
  - npm install
  - npm run start (or npm run dev for development with nodemon, depending on package.json scripts)
  - Open http://localhost:3000 in a browser to view the Snack Attack game.

Notes and context
- The project is actively documented with design prompts and action plans, indicating an intent to evolve from a tech demo into a full playable game with enhanced interactions, visuals, and audio, plus potential mobile and deployment considerations.
- The current codebase emphasizes a modular client-side game engine with a lightweight server to host and serve assets, setting a clear path for future feature additions as outlined in the included planning docs.

If you’d like, I can extract a more granular map of modules and their responsibilities from the codebase (based on actual code snippets) or provide a phased MVP roadmap tailored to your current priorities.
