Title: Snack Attack
Genre: Action, Arcade
Platform: Web (using Three.js)
Gameplay Style: Fast-paced, reflex-based

Objective:
- The player must feed the character with the appropriate snacks while avoiding unhealthy ones. The goal is to score as many points as possible within a time limit.

Gameplay Loop:
- Snacks (candy, fruits, vegetables, and hot foods) fall from the top of the screen at increasing speeds.
- The player must quickly decide whether to catch or avoid each snack.
- Catching healthy snacks (fruits and vegetables) increases the score.
- Catching unhealthy snacks (candy and hot foods) decreases the score or health bar.

Character Reactions:
- Smile: When a healthy snack is caught.
- Sad Face: When an unhealthy snack is caught.
- Surprised Face: When a hot food is caught, indicating a special effect.

Controls:
- Simple controls: Use left and right arrow keys (or swipe left/right on mobile) to move the character head to catch or avoid snacks.

Scoring System:
- Each healthy snack caught adds points.
- Each unhealthy snack caught deducts points or decreases health.
- Catching hot foods triggers special effects (positive or negative).
- Combo multiplier for consecutive healthy snacks caught without missing or catching an unhealthy one.

Levels and Difficulty:
- Increase the speed and frequency of falling snacks as the game progresses.
- Introduce new types of snacks with different point values or effects (e.g., golden apple for bonus points).

Power-Ups and Special Effects:
- Shield: Protects from the next unhealthy snack.
- Double Points: Temporarily doubles the points earned for healthy snacks.
- Slow Motion: Slows down the falling snacks for a short duration.
- Chillies and Hot Foods:
  - Chilli Pepper: Temporarily increases the speed of falling snacks, making the game more challenging.
  - Hot Sauce Bottle: Temporarily reverses controls (left becomes right and vice versa).
  - Spicy Nachos: Reduces the score multiplier for a short time.
  - Cooling Cucumber (Power-Up): Counters the effects of hot foods and restores normal gameplay.

Scoreboard:
- Display the top 100 players' scores.
- Allow players to enter their names after the game ends if their score is in the top 100.

Visual and Audio Design:
- Bright, colorful snacks with clear distinctions between healthy and unhealthy ones. Hot foods have a distinctive fiery glow.
- Expressive character head with noticeable emotion changes.
- Positive sound for catching healthy snacks.
- Negative sound for catching unhealthy snacks.

- Customization: Allow players to customize their character's appearance or the background theme.

Narrative:
- Provide a simple backstory, such as the character trying to stay healthy by eating right while avoiding the temptation of junk food and handling the occasional spicy snack.

User Interface:
- HUD: Display current score, health bar, power-ups, and the duration of special effects clearly.
- Pause Menu: Allow players to pause the game and resume.
- End Screen: Show final score and ranking, with an option to restart or exit.

Incorporating More Snacks:
- Appearance Rate: Adjust the frequency of different snacks based on their healthiness. Healthy snacks appear more often, while unhealthy ones appear less frequently but with higher penalties.
- Visual Distinction: Use vibrant and distinct colors to make it easy for players to quickly identify healthy, unhealthy, and hot foods.
- Special Effects: Add small animations or effects (like sparkles, glows, or flames) to special items to make them stand out.

Balancing the Game:
- Difficulty Curve: As the game progresses, increase the appearance rate of unhealthy and hot foods, and the speed at which all snacks fall.
- Randomization: Randomize the appearance order of snacks to keep the gameplay unpredictable and challenging.
- Combo System: Reward players for catching multiple healthy snacks in a row with combo points or temporary power-ups.

Story and Setting:
- Consider different environments or levels where snacks might be more thematic (e.g., a fruit orchard, a vegetable garden, a candy store, a fast food restaurant, a spicy food festival).
